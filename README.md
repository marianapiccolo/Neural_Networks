# Neural Networks

**Artificial Neural Networks** (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and perform machine learning tasks. They consist of basic units called **artificial neurons** or **nodes**, which are interconnected to form a complex network.

## Structure of Neural Networks

A typical neural network is organized into three types of layers:

1. **Input Layer:** This layer receives the raw data that will be processed by the network. Each node in this layer represents a feature or variable of the input data.

2. **Hidden Layers:** Located between the input layer and the output layer, these layers perform the heavy processing. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives weighted inputs from the previous layers, applies an activation function, and transmits the result to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer can vary depending on the complexity of the problem.

3. **Output Layer:** This layer produces the final output of the network, whether it be a classification, a regression, or another form of output. Each neuron in this layer represents a possible class or output value.

## How Neural Networks Work

The learning process of a neural network involves adjusting the **weights** of the connections between neurons. These weights determine the influence of an input or a previous layer on the next. During training, the network processes the input data and compares the generated output with the expected output. Based on this comparison, the weights are adjusted to minimize the error through a process called **backpropagation**.

The **activation function** is a crucial component that decides whether a neuron should be "activated" or not. Functions such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent are common, each with characteristics that make them more suitable for certain types of problems.

## Types of Neural Networks

There are various neural network architectures, each optimized for different tasks:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Primarily used for image processing, they utilize convolutional layers to capture spatial features in two-dimensional data.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Ideal for processing sequential data, such as text or time series, as they have internal loops that allow information to persist over time.

- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** The simplest form of a neural network, where neuron connections move only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without loops.

## Applications

Neural networks are applied in a variety of fields, including:

- **Computer Vision:** Object recognition, image classification, and image segmentation.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Machine translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting products, movies, or music based on user preferences.
- **Gaming and Simulations:** Creating AI for games and complex simulations.

## Conclusion

Neural networks are a powerful tool in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, capable of solving complex problems and automating tasks across various domains. This repository contains implementations, examples, and experiments related to neural networks, providing a starting point for understanding and exploring this innovative technology.
